# Benchmark Plan: 2025-12-30 (v6)

## Overview

This benchmark evaluates Pith's context quality on the Pith codebase itself (self-test).

## Repository

- **Repository**: Pith (self-test)
- **Path**: `/home/user/pith`
- **Size**: 24 TypeScript files, ~11.8k lines
- **Commit**: 7a3ce04

## Configuration

- **Model**: qwen/qwen-turbo (fast, cost-effective)
- **Pith version**: 7a3ce04 (latest)

## Tasks to Evaluate

Following the benchmarking methodology, selecting 5 tasks covering all categories:

### Architecture Task
**A1**: "What are the main components of this codebase and how do they interact?"

### Specific Behavior Task
**B1**: "How does the extraction cache determine if a file needs re-extraction?"

### Cross-Module Relationship Task
**R1**: "What files would be affected if I changed the WikiNode interface?"

### Debugging Task
**D1**: "Generation completes but some nodes have empty prose. What should I investigate?"

### Modification Task
**M1**: "How would I add support for JavaScript (.js) files in addition to TypeScript?"

## Expected Duration

Based on previous benchmark runs on this repository:

| Stage | Expected Time |
|-------|---------------|
| Extraction | ~9s |
| Build | ~2s |
| Generation | ~170s (39 nodes × ~4s each) |
| **Pipeline Total** | ~3 minutes |
| Task Evaluation | ~10-15 minutes (5 tasks × 2-3 min each) |
| **Total Benchmark** | ~15-20 minutes |

## Cost Estimate

- **Generation**: ~$0.50-1.00 (qwen-turbo at ~39 nodes)
- **Evaluation LLM calls**: Included in session cost (using Claude)

## Success Criteria

- Complete all 5 tasks with both Pith and Control approaches
- Score each on 5 criteria (Relevance, Completeness, Accuracy, Efficiency, Actionability)
- Compare to previous benchmark results (v5-comprehensive)
- Document information gaps and improvement recommendations

## Comparison Baseline

Previous benchmark (v5-comprehensive, 15 tasks):
- Pith Average: 15.5/25 (62%)
- Control Average: 23.9/25 (95.6%)

## Notes

- Using all 5 task types for comprehensive coverage
- Will compare against v5-comprehensive results for trend analysis
